# Home screen integration check on a dedicated "Budgie-System" simulator
# (created fresh; no other simulator is touched):
#   1. the Flutter build is installed and launched once (it registers its
#      three dynamic quick actions, including "Add by Voice"), then the
#      onboarding flag is preset so no tour holds the routes back;
#   2. SystemIntegrationUITests installs the Swift build over it and drives
#      SpringBoard: leftover Flutter quick action, Swift quick actions,
#      budgetapp:// links through the system prompt, and the Quick Add widget.
# Usage: system_flow.sh <path/to/flutter/Runner.app>
