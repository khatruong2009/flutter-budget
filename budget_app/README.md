## iOS Home Screen Widget

- Build/run the iOS app once to register the WidgetKit extension.
- Add the small "Budget Quick Add" widget from the widget gallery; the top button opens the Add Income modal, the bottom opens Add Expense.
- The widget uses the custom scheme `budgetapp://` to deep link back into the app.
